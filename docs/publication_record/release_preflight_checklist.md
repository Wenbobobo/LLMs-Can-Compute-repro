# Release Preflight Checklist

This checklist defines the minimum outward-facing sync required after the
current freeze candidate is assembled.

## Wording and scope

- [ ] `README.md` stays a restrained landing page and keeps the current narrow
  non-goals explicit.
- [ ] `STATUS.md` reflects the same frozen paper scope and names the current
  next action without implying a new evidence wave.
- [ ] `release_summary_draft.md` remains the source for short public-surface
  wording.

## Paper-facing ledgers

- [ ] `manuscript_bundle_draft.md` still matches the fixed section and artifact
  ownership on current scope.
- [ ] `paper_bundle_status.md`, `layout_decision_log.md`,
  `freeze_candidate_criteria.md`, `main_text_order.md`, and
  `appendix_companion_scope.md` remain synchronized.
- [ ] `blog_release_rules.md` still records the blocked-blog state explicitly.

## Machine-audited guards

- [ ] `results/P1_paper_readiness/summary.json` still reports `10/10` ready
  figure/table items on the frozen scope.
- [ ] `results/P5_public_surface_sync/summary.json` reports zero blocked items.
- [ ] `results/P5_callout_alignment/summary.json` reports zero blocked rows.

## Release hygiene

- [ ] The current repo state is clean before any outward sync commit.
- [ ] No local-only source material under `docs/Origin/` or `docs/origin/`
  enters the public surface.
- [ ] Blog work remains blocked unless `blog_release_rules.md` is satisfied in
  full.
