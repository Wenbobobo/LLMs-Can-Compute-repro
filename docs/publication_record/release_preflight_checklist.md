# Release Preflight Checklist

This checklist defines the minimum outward-facing sync required after the
current freeze candidate is assembled.

## Wording and scope

- [ ] `README.md` stays a restrained landing page and keeps the current narrow
  non-goals explicit.
- [ ] `STATUS.md` reflects the current frozen `H21` same-endpoint state and
  records the preserved `P12` closeout plus the current planning-only
  `R24/R25` handoff while keeping `P13` downstream-only.
- [ ] `release_summary_draft.md` remains the source for short public-surface
  wording downstream of landed `H21`.

## Paper-facing ledgers

- [ ] `manuscript_bundle_draft.md` still matches the fixed section and artifact
  ownership on current scope.
- [ ] `paper_bundle_status.md`, `layout_decision_log.md`,
  `freeze_candidate_criteria.md`, `main_text_order.md`, and
  `appendix_companion_scope.md` remain synchronized.
- [ ] `blog_release_rules.md` still records the blocked-blog state explicitly.

## Machine-audited guards

- [ ] `results/P1_paper_readiness/summary.json` still reports `10/10` ready
  figure/table items on the frozen scope.
- [ ] `results/H21_refreeze_after_r22_r23/summary.json` reports zero blocked
  items on the current refrozen control surface.
- [ ] `results/H19_refreeze_and_next_scope_decision/summary.json` remains
  available as the preserved pre-`R22/R23` control surface.
- [ ] `results/H17_refreeze_and_conditional_frontier_recheck/summary.json`
  still reports zero blocked items on the preserved prior same-scope refreeze
  surface.
- [ ] `results/H15_refreeze_and_decision_sync/summary.json` reports zero
  blocked items on the preserved prior refrozen control surface.
- [ ] `results/H14_core_first_reopen_guard/summary.json` reports zero blocked
  items on the preserved core-first reopen control surface.
- [ ] `results/H13_post_h12_governance_stage_health/summary.json` reports zero
  blocked items on the preserved governance/runtime handoff.
- [ ] `results/P5_public_surface_sync/summary.json` reports zero blocked items.
- [ ] `results/P5_callout_alignment/summary.json` reports zero blocked rows.
- [ ] `results/H2_bundle_lock_audit/summary.json` reports zero blocked items.
- [ ] `results/release_worktree_hygiene_snapshot/summary.json` classifies the
  current release-commit readiness and reports no diff-check content issues.
- [ ] `results/V1_full_suite_validation_runtime_timing_followup/summary.json`
  reports `healthy_but_slow` with zero timed-out files.

## Release hygiene

- [ ] Use `results/release_worktree_hygiene_snapshot/summary.json` to decide
  whether an outward sync commit is currently blocked by a dirty tree.
- [ ] No local-only source material under `docs/Origin/` or `docs/origin/`
  enters the public surface.
- [ ] Blog work remains blocked unless `blog_release_rules.md` is satisfied in
  full.
